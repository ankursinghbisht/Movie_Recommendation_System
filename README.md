# Movie Recommendation System
In the Movie Recommendation system, we offer suggestions for movies similar to what the user inputs.

## Introduction

We built a system to recommend movies. We gathered important information about each film, like genre, cast, and story. Then, we used Content-Based filtering to suggest similar movies. This involved creating a shared description for all the movie features and comparing them to find good matches.
## Why I Built it?
- Data Exploration: Through the preprocessing and vectorization of movie data, I delved into the data exploration process, uncovering patterns, trends, and insights about the movies in the dataset. This process led me to discover intriguing relationships between movies that I could leverage for recommendations.
- Showcasing AI in Everyday Life: I was motivated by the opportunity to showcase how AI and machine learning can be applied in practical, everyday scenarios.
- Learning and Skill Development: Developing this recommendation system provided an excellent opportunity for me to hone my skills in data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques. I wanted to challenge myself by delving into content-based filtering methods and gaining hands-on experience with vectorization and similarity calculations.
- Passion for Movies: As a movie enthusiast, I wanted to create a personalized movie recommendation system that suggests films based on their content and characteristics rather than relying solely on ratings. This project allowed me to combine my love for movies with my interest in data science and programming.
